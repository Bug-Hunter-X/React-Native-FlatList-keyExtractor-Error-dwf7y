This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and setting the `keyExtractor` prop incorrectly.  The `keyExtractor` prop requires a function that returns a unique key for each item in the data array. If this function is not correctly implemented, it can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect rendering, performance issues, or even crashes.  For example, if you use the index as the key, and the data array is modified, the FlatList may not render correctly.

```javascript
// Incorrect keyExtractor
<FlatList
  data={data}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```
