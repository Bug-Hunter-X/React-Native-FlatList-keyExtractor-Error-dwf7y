The solution is to use a unique identifier from your data as the key.  If your data objects have an `id` property, that's the ideal choice.

```javascript
// Correct keyExtractor
<FlatList
  data={data}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

If your data doesn't have a unique ID, you can generate one using a library like `uuid`.

```javascript
import uuid from 'uuid';

// Generate unique IDs for data items if they don't have them
data = data.map(item => ({...item, id: uuid()}));
```
This ensures that each item has a unique key, preventing the errors caused by using the index.
